# GgraphTool

The Ggraph tool is an open-source Grasshopper plugin built upon the Quick Graph library, empowering users to design and modify personalized 3D graphs with custom attributes and linked object. The Ggraph tool contains various components including the extraction of corridor skeletons, the removal of dead ends, and the enhancement of edges. Additionally, it allows users to save the graph as JSON or seamlessly push the prepared graph to Aura, a real-time database service provided by Neo4j. 

You can just download and copy the Ggraph_0.1 folder to Grasshopper's Libraries folder to use it
